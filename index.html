    <h1>What is UI / UX</h1>
    <p>    
    In this course, you will be introduced to both the theory and practice behind UI and UX Design.
    You will first establish a foundation of the core concepts and methodologies utilized by industry
    professionals. You will implement those methodologies in a hands-on exploration of the tools, 
    techniques, and deliverables used by designers to plan the future of a product.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Well what is Design:
    definition of design: “to plan and make (something) for a specific use or purpose.”
    In recent years, user interface (UI) design and user experience (UX) design have been 
    at the forefront of conversations about design.
    </p>

    <h3>What is User Interface (UI) Design?</h3>
    <pre>
    A user interface is the interface through which a user 
    interacts with a device. For example, on a mobile phone,
    the user interface is what is displayed on the screen of 
    the device.
    </pre>
    <h3>What is User Experience (UX)</h3>
    <p>
        User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user's 
        interaction with the company, its services, and its products.

    <h3>The Phases of UX</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The user's journey:
            The entire process surrounding use of a product, from the problem to be solved through the impact of the solution.
        </li>
        <li>User research: Qualitative and quantitative research to put the user at the center of the design process.</li>
        <p>During the UX design process designers will produce a wide variety of “artifacts” and project <b>deliverables</b>  as part of their UX design methodology.</p>
        
        <h3>
            An example of a deliverable would be:</h3>
            <br>
            <li>Personnas</li>
        
            <p>A Personna is just an example of what your target audience is - why they would use your product, Some data such as average spend on a product, How often would they use your product and for what purpose. A biusness may need to have multiple personnnas to show multiple target customers and what different types of customers they good have.</p>
            
            <li>Journey Maps</li>
            <p>Shows the journey a customer would take in buying your product</p>

            <li>StoryBoard</li>
            <p>A sequence of panels (often resembling a comic book) depicting a user story chronologically. Here you depict the user's story as to why they purchase your product - stating there needs and ideas.I personally do not find this as useful as the others</p>
    
            <li>Prototypes</li>
            <p>Iterative models, sketches or wireframes of a design used to gather feedback and inform the final design.</p>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Five Elements of UI Design</h3>
    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <p>What is the product that will be created to solve the problem? Within this layer, the team defines functional requirements (what features to build) and content requirements (written and visual information to include).</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Structure</h4>
    <p>How is the design organized and how do interactions work? This layer includes information architecture (the structure and organization of content) and interaction design (the interactive experience of the product).</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Skeleton</h4>
    <p>How is information presented and arranged? This layer begins to consider interface design (design of interface elements), navigation design (how users move through a system), and information design (presenting information to facilitate understanding). A common output at this stage is a set of wireframes.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Surface</h4>
    <p>How does the product look and feel to users? This stage emphasizes visual design, for example, what colors and typefaces are used, and is the stage where UI design is front and center (though it is not exclusive to the surface).</p>

    <h2>The Double Diamond Model</h2>
    <img width="800px" src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/intro-to-ui-and-ux/key-methodologies/double-diamond.svg" alt="">
    <p>The double diamond is a broadly applicable process model for a cross-functional, iterative design or innovation process.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The two-diamond structure of the diagram illustrates two modes of thinking that occur during the strategy and execution stages of the design process:</p>
    <li>Divergent thinking explores many possible solutions and generates novel ideas.</li>
    <li>Convergent thinking analyzes, filters, and focuses ideas and leads to decisions.</li>
    <p>This model promotes creativity and innovation while making it clear when decisions should be made and when teams should commit to a direction</p>

    <h3>There are four Steps in The Double Diamond Model</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Discover <br>
            Explore the problem and learn the users and the market through surverys and interviews
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>2. Define <br>
            Sort and anylize information gathered during the discover phase - and dive into a problem you're trying to solve
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>3. Develop <br>
            Generate multiple ideas/ possible solutions through brainstorming, workshops - test your different ideas with users or within your
            company to see what resonates
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>4. Deliver <br>
            Develope and deliver a solution, continue evaluating and testing developed products.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Product Cycle</h2>
    <p>Now you have found a product and have designed a possible plan for how to make the product and what it will do  -  Now let's look at the Product Cycle
        and how design fits into product developement </p>
    <img width="800px" src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/intro-to-ui-and-ux/key-methodologies/product-development-lifecycle.svg" alt="">
    <ol>
        <h3>The Product Life Cycle consists of 5 stages</h3>
        <li>
            Brainstorm: <br>
            Starting from a defined problem and starting to brainstorm solution / ideas to resolve said problem - using Market Research
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Define: <br>
            The team aligns on specifications for the product by defining the vision, goals, target users, features, benefits, and success metrics.
        </li><br>
        <li>Design: <br>
            The product is designed from low-fidelity to high-fidelity, starting with sketches and wireframes and moving to prototypes and a completed interface.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Test: <br>
            The product or prototype is tested to ensure it works as intended. Testing can range from informal internal testing of low-fidelity prototypes to usability testing of a high-fidelity prototype or final product by external users.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Launch: <br>
            The final design is released to the public, but the cycle doesn't end here. Typically, testing continues even after the product has launched, and the cycle continues.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Design Thinking</h2>
    <p>Like the double diamond model, design thinking requires both divergent (creativity) and convergent (problem solving) thinking.</p>
    <p>Design thinking's core activities are inspiration, ideation, and implementation, which occur across the five stages of the process:</p>
    <img  width="750px" src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/intro-to-ui-and-ux/key-methodologies/design-thinking-5-steps.svg" alt="">
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Empathize <br>
            Undestand the user and the landscape
        </li> <br>
        <li> 
            Define <br>
            Define the problem and align biusness goals and user needs
        </li><br>
        <li> 
            Ideate <br>
            Generate a range of solutions and possible ways to tackle the problem - requires creativity
        </li><br>
        <li> 
            Prototype <br>
            Practice potential solutions by creating a product and gathering feedback
        </li><br>
        <li> 
            Test <br>
            Test the best solutions. Prototyping or testing may lead to redefining the problem altogether.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <br><hr><hr><br>

    <h2>User-Centered Design</h2>
    <p>User-Centered Design (UCD) puts the users / targett audience at the center of product developement and involves them into the design from the
        beginning. Here you ask for user input both when developing the product and after launch - It follows a similar procedure as the others with slight
        differences.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Good UI / UX</h2>
    <p>The methodologies we've described so far ensure that teams are aligned and that user needs are at the center of the process, 
        but what defines a “good” user experience? What makes a product or design truly great?</p>
    <h4>Google says there are four components to "Good" UI/UX</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Usable - easy to find functionality
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Equitable - Benefiting individuals across skills and backgrounds
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Enjoyable - pleasing to use beyond functionality
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Useful - Does what it should do
        </li><br>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
    <p>Information architecture is the organization, prioritization, and presentation of information within products,
         websites, and other software applications. Effective information architecture is important because it allows 
         users to complete tasks with the least effort required. We can visually represent this information using a site map.</p>
